MMS 146 – Object-Oriented Programming**

Group L: Exequiel Manalo, Michael Porcadilla, Nathaniel Cajuday, Tin Sarosa

**What is this project?**

InfoLympics is a quiz game we created for our OOP class. It’s based on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, but we gave it a twist: instead of cash prizes, players earn increasing ₱ winnings for every correct answer.

Our chosen theme is Pop Culture & Entertainment. Questions are grouped by easy, medium, and hard, so players can test themselves at different levels.

**How it works**
1. The player enters their name.

2. The game asks questions randomly (answers are shuffled too).

3. Each correct answer increases the total winnings.

4. A wrong answer ends the game immediately.

5. The player can choose to replay.

**Main Classes**
1. Question Class – handles questions, answers, and checking if the answer is correct.

2. Player Class – manages the player’s name.

3. QuizGame Class – runs the quiz, keeps track of score, winnings, and game flow.

**How to play**
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Save all files (QuizGame.py, Questions.py, Players.py) in one folder.

3. Open terminal in that folder and run.

4. Follow the instructions and enjoy!
